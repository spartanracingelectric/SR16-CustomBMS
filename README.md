## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### PR Titles
- PR titles should be a **one-sentence overall description** of the PR.
- If you can't fit an overall description in the PR title, the PR is likely too large and should be broken into smaller changes.

### PR Description
- The description should be more **in-depth**, explaining:
  - The purpose of the PR.
  - The changes made.
  - Any other relevant details. 

### PR Practices
- After completing testing for a feature, **squash commits** before making a PR.
- PRs should be **for a singular feature**.
- Avoid PRs with **giant changes**

### Approval Process
- PRs must be **approved by at least one designer** before merging.
